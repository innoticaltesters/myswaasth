Having a robust testing structure is an integral part of your testing , for the successful delivery of a software/software system.

A well structured testing structure has many benefits, both from the developers, project managers point of view and from the simplest tester who
is tasked with writing the most basic unit or integration tests for your website. A well structured test approach reduces the time taken fro the
debugging of a software fault/test script failure and other such failures that needs to be analysed and fixed, so the users have the optimal
experience of the product that we are supposed to deliver.

At MySwaasth, we belive in simplyfing things a lot and one of the most important points in simplyfying this is to have a planned structure for
the tests that we have out there for the MySwaasth website front end and back end.

This document deals with defining the test structure of the MySwaasth module, inside the MySwaasth product.


At a high level, the test structure is modelled in this way
